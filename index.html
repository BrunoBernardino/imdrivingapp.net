					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>Don't use your phone while driving, but don't ignore your friends!</p>
					<p>The objective of I'm Driving is to prevent you from using your smartphone while driving.</p>
					<p>It is based on and promotes Oprah Winfrey's No Phone Zone Pledge.</p>
					<p>The Lite version was featured on T3 Magazine's March 2011 issue (UK only).</p>
					<h2>How it works</h2>
					<p>Basically you just have to turn the app on before starting to drive, and off afterwards.</p>
					<p>It works by sending an automated (user-defined) message to anyone who tries to contact you via a call or text message.</p>
					<p>You have a lot of settings (Reply only to contacts, Silent mode). This version doesn't include "Private Group" functionality.</p>
					<p>If you need this feature (or want to know what it is), check I'm Driving (full) app.</p>
					<p>If you like this version but don't want any ads or just want to support our cause, please buy the I'm Driving Lite.</p>
					<h2>Translations</h2>
					<p>Portuguese (Portugal)</p>
					<p>English (USA)</p>
					<h2>Bugs</h2>
					<p>There aren't currently any known bugs.</p>
					<p>Please report any bugs you may find. We want to make this app a must-have to improve road-safety and diminish deaths on the road due to phone usage.</p>

					<h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
					<h2>Will there be an iPhone version?</h2>
					<p>Unfortunately the iPhone SDK doesn't allow any app to do what I'm Driving needs to do, but we're waiting on a new SDK version that will allow us to.</p>
					<h2>Are you sponsored by or affiliated to Oprah Winfrey's No Phone Zone pledge?</h2>
					<p>No.</p>
					<p>We've tried to reach Oprah to get her support/recognition or our app, but without any luck.</p>
					<p>We do, however, support and promote Oprah Winfrey's No Phone Zone pledge, and it was with it that we came up with the idea/concept for this app. To make driving safer and easier to be safe, without compromise.</p>
